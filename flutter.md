# Flutter Coding Test

## Overview

This is a small project aimed at assessing your keenness to be part of our team, as well as your expertise and understanding in Flutter and Dart. The project focuses on coding a UI for a booking system, based on the given Figma prototype.

No need to implement the back end part. The main goal is to cover the frontend development, with specific focus on the visual aspects of the user interface.

Please set up boilerplate for the project, enable Flutter web so it can be accessed from a web browser, and ensure apps can run both on IOS and Android mobile.

Instead of the back-end, you'll use either a mock server of your choice or simple hardcoded data structures to feed information into the UI.

## Figma Prototype

You will be asked to code the UI based on the following Figma prototype: [The prototype link attached here](https://www.figma.com/file/72oA2Ve9SgvnxX2RPGrS1q/%5BHalmet%5D-Admin-Website---Exte[â€¦]=design&node-id=3449%3A182963&mode=design&t=qCy3MUoNYFU3WQQV-1)

## Tasks

- **Task 1**: Setup the project using Flutter and Dart, and configure properly for web, Android, and iOS.
- **Task 2**: Analyze the provided prototype and estimate the time required to implement the UI.
- **Task 3**: Implement components for the UI using Flutter, based on the design provided in the Figma link.
- **Task 4**: Use appropriate naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions to ensure future maintainability and team-wide understanding.
- **Task 5**: Write comprehensive Readme file on how to run the application on both platforms and web.

## Deliverables 

The final version should include: 

1. The estimated time to accomplish the project.
2. The Flutter app code that meets the criteria (accessible from the web, iOS, and Android).
3. A short video demonstrating the working of the UI. This can be uploaded on any cloud storage and then shared with us.
4. Readme file.

At the conclusion of this project, you'll submit a Github link or zip with everything listed above.

## Expectations

Please incorporate Dart best practices, including meaningful variable, function, and class names. The code should be neatly structured, easily readable, and accompanied by inline comments where necessary.

Your skills in estimates, technical understanding, problem-solving, and writing clean, simple, and efficient code will be evaluated.

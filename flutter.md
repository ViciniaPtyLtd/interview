# Flutter Coding Test with GraphQL, Apollo and Hasura

## Overview

This is a small project aimed at assessing your passion, expertise, and understanding in Flutter, Dart, GraphQL, Apollo, and Hasura. The project focuses on coding a UI for a booking system, based on the given Figma prototype, and interacting with a Hasura GraphQL server.

Please set up boilerplate for the project, enable Flutter web so it can be accessed from a web browser, and ensure apps can run both on IOS and Android mobile. You should set up a Hasura project and use GraphQL with Apollo to feed data into your UI.

## Figma Prototype

You will be asked to code the UI based on the following Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/Y2YP9DayfSKCOFuomjjP1V/Dev-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=w1ikpWQjKoq0NUwm-1

## Hasura GraphQL Server

You need to set up a free trial account at [Hasura](https://hasura.io/pricing/) and create a new GraphQL server. 
Add an `items` table which will hold the items to be displayed in the booking system. You can generate and use dummy data for all other informational needs in the UI.

## Tasks

- **Task 1**: Set up a free trial account on Hasura and create a new GraphQL project.
- **Task 2**: Add an `items` table to your Hasura project with the appropriate fields.
- **Task 3**: Setup the project using Flutter, Dart, GraphQL, and Apollo, also configuring properly for web, Android, and iOS.
- **Task 4**: Analyze the provided prototype and estimate the time required to implement the UI.
- **Task 5**: Implement components for the UI using Flutter, based on the design provided in the Figma link.
- **Task 6**: Use GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with your Hasura GraphQL server and feed data from the `items` table into your UI.
- **Task 7**: Create dummy data for all other informational needs in your UI.
- **Task 8**: Use appropriate naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions to ensure future maintainability and team-wide understanding.
- **Task 9**: Write comprehensive readme file on how to run the application on both platforms and web, interact with the Hasura project and use GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Deliverables 

The final version should include: 

1. The estimated time to accomplish the project.
2. The Flutter app code that works with GraphQL and Apollo, and meets the criteria (accessible from the web, iOS, and Android).
3. A short video demonstrating the working of the UI, the GraphQL queries and mutations in action, and a walk-through of your Hasura project setup. This can be uploaded on any cloud storage and then shared with us.
4. Readme file that includes the setup details of the project, explanation of Hasura project setup, GraphQL usage, and any other information deemed necessary.

At the conclusion of this project, you'll submit a Github link or zip file with everything listed above.

## Expectations

Please incorporate Dart best practices, including meaningful variable, function, and class names. The code should be neatly structured, easily readable, and accompanied by inline comments where necessary.

Your skills in accurate estimation, technical understanding, problem-solving, including the use of GraphQL with Apollo, and writing clean, simple, and efficient code will be evaluated.

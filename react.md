# React Coding Test

## Overview

This project is designed to evaluate your commitment, understanding, and skills in ReactJS and Ant Design (Antd) version 5. The main goal of this project is to create a frontend UI based on a given Figma prototype. No backend implementation is required for this project. Instead, you can use mock data to feed information into the UI.

## Figma Prototype

You will be asked to code the UI based on the following Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/Y2YP9DayfSKCOFuomjjP1V/Dev-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=w1ikpWQjKoq0NUwm-1

## Tasks

- **Task 1**: Set up the project using ReactJS and Antd v5 and configure it for web browsing.
- **Task 2**: Analyse the provided prototype and estimate the time required to implement the UI.
- **Task 3**: Implement UI components for the design using ReactJS and Antd v5, as per the design provided in the Figma link.
- **Task 4**: Use appropriate naming conventions for variables, functions, and component names to ensure future code maintainability and team-wide understanding.
- **Task 5**: Write a comprehensive Readme file to explain how to run the application.

## Deliverables 

Your submission should include: 

1. The estimated time to complete the project.
2. The ReactJS code of the project developed.
3. A short video demonstrating the working of the UI. This can be uploaded on any cloud storage and then shared with us.
4. A Readme file.

At the end of this project, please submit a Github link or zip file that includes all the above materials.

## Expectations

Please incorporate best practices in JavaScript and ReactJS, including meaningful variable, function, and component names. The code should be well-structured, easily readable, and accompanied by inline comments where necessary.

We will be evaluating your skills in accurate estimation, technical understanding, problem-solving, and the ability to write clean, straightforward, and efficient code.

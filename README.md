# Flutter & React Test Project

***

## Overview 

This project is designed to evaluate potential developers for roles involving either Flutter/Dart or React/Antd v5. Candidates will be assessed on commitment, understanding of the respective frameworks, ability to estimate task durations accurately, and skills in writing clear, maintainable code. 

Candidates will be required to construct a UI based on a provided Figma prototype. While no back-end implementation is required, the use of mock data or hardcoded data structures will be necessary for rendering the UI. Projects will need to be set up correctly to be accessible via web browsing, while Flutter projects will additionally require configuration for Android and iOS mobile accessibility.

## Flutter Test Project

For Flutter candidates, the objective will involve:

- Setting up a project using Flutter and Dart
- Configuring for web, Android, and iOS platforms
- Constructing UI components based on a prototype 
- Applying meaningful naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions
- Documenting a clear, comprehensive README file

[Details](flutter.md)

## React Test Project

For React candidates, the objectives will involve:

- Setting up a project using ReactJS and Ant Design v5
- Configuring the project for web browsing
- Constructing UI components using ReactJS and Antd v5
- Applying meaningful naming conventions for variables, functions, and component names
- Documenting a clear, comprehensive README file

[Details](react.md)

## Delivery 

At the conclusion of either project, candidates will be expected to:

1. Provide an estimate of time for completion
2. Share the complete project code 
3. Record a short video demonstrating UI functionality 
4. Submit a README file providing instructions to run the application

Submissions are to be made via shared GitHub links or zipped files.

## Assessment Criteria

Candidates will be assessed using several criteria, namely:

- Accuracy of estimations
- Technical understanding
- Problem-solving skills
- Ability to write clean, understandable, and efficient code
- Use of best practices in Dart (for Flutter) / JavaScript and ReactJS (for React)
